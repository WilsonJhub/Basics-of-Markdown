# Basics-of-Markdown

## Heading
The heading is the title and topic of discussion. There are a few ways that the syntax for the heading can be used.   
One "#" symbol labels that line of code as a heading. The amount "#" at the beginning of the line of code is what determines which heading number that seciton is.    
For example: one "#", is your first heading. Two "##", is your second heading. And so on.   

### Bold Letters
Often times in writing, we need to provide a certain amount of intesity to our words. **Bolding** allows us to achieve that emphasis. To bold your letters, you'll need to add "***" in front and behind your word of interest.  
See below for few examples:   
- **Hello**
- **Goodbye**

#### ***EMOJICODE*** 😉

Emojis has evolved into another language these days. So, naturally we need to learn how to add them to our lines of coding. All we need to do is type a, ":". Any letter after the colon will populate your screen with the available emojis. Make sure to only use lowercase letters when searching through the emojis; uppercase does not work. 

Example: 😃 🙂
