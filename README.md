## Heading
The heading is the title and topic of discussion. There are a few ways that the syntax for the heading can be used.   
One "#" symbol labels that line of code as a heading. The amount "#" at the beginning of the line of code is what determines which heading number that seciton is.    
For example: one "#", is your first heading. Two "##", is your second heading. And so on.   

### Bold Letters
Often times in writing, we need to provide a certain amount of intesity to our words. ***Bolding*** allows us to achieve that emphasis. To bold your letters, you'll need to add "***" in front and behind your word of interest.  
See below for few examples:   
- ***Hello***
- ***Goodbye***
